# Shoul Be Home By Now

## Tech Stack
- **Astro** (Static Site Generator with SSR)
- **ReactJS** (UI Library)
- **Supabase** (Database & Authentication)
- **Tasker** for Android (Automation)
- **Life360** for Android and iOS (Location Sharing)

## About the App
My app leverages **Tasker** on my personal phone to capture Life360 "Arrived Home" notifications when my kids arrive home from school and automatically submit an api call and creates an entry in **Supabase** database. 

I use this data to create a dashboard that shows:
- Whether they have arrived home from school today.
- Their average arrival time, to easily spot if they are running later than usual.

This setup helps me stay informed in a simple, real-time way without needing to constantly check my phone.
